- You can review any bugs or any error in your code in the folder logs_students/
- The tester compile your main with ft namespace, and re-compile using std namespace, then checking the diff between the two compilated files.

### ðŸ˜Ž Automatically find your .hpp files in your project, no configuration needed.


## LAUNCH :

 - Clone this repo into your ft_containers, and type **bash launch.sh**


## OPTIONS :

 - Is you launch bash launch.sh without options, the tester will test all main find in main folder.
 - You can select 1 folder to test, using : bash launch.sh main/vec_capacity/
 - You can select 1 main to test, using : bash launch.sh main/vec_capacity/max_size.cpp

 - If there is an error during the test, you can find it in the folder logs_students, the .log file will be generated only if an error is detected. if you want to generate all .log file (to check by yourself the diff), you can add **--verbose** option.



#### ðŸ‘‹ If you have any problem with the test, it would be nice to create an "Issue", it will take 3 minutes of your time and it will help me to make the test accessible to more people. 
#### Remember that if you encounter an error, you are probably not the only one and your "Issue" will surely help other people.
